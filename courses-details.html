                            <h4>Just What Is My Emotional Authenticity Method & How Can It Help YOU?</h4>

                            <p>Modern Neuroscience shows that every thought and action we take starts with an emotion.
                                Therefore, if any part of our personal or professional life is not where we want it to
                                be, the source is emotional, and the solution is Emotional Authenticity.</p>

                            <p>In addition, we now know that emotions are learned responses to the environment and
                                culture in which we were raised. This may sound crazy, but that means a life experience
                                in your childhood actually created your emotional reaction as an adult.
                            </p>

                            <p>Therefore, our inability to like ourselves, feel empowered, avoid toxic relationships,
                                pursue our passions, get unstuck, stop our self-sabotage, control our feelings and
                                responses and reach our potential started as a child.
                            </p>

                            <p>That is why we all need the trailblazing, transformational process of Emotional
                                Authenticity to reclaim our authentic selves.
                            </p>

                            <p>With Emotional Authenticity, we can manifest our destiny and live in our legacy
                                personally, professionally, relationally, and most of all, within ourselves.
                            </p>

                            <h3>What are the 7 ways
                                Emotional Authenticity helps you more than Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h3>


                            <p>1- Emotional Authenticity is based on the latest neuroscientific model of the brain and
                                how it processes emotions.
                            </p>


                            <p>EQ is based on a brain model that was disproved before the book was written.
                            </p>


                            <p>2- Emotional Authenticity shows you how all your emotion and feeling definitions are
                                learned in childhood. Thus giving you complete emotional self-awareness
                                EQ does not. </p>


                            <p>3- Emotional Authenticity provides a process to show you how those learned definitions
                                are inaccurate, pain-filled, and emotionally sabotaging you.
                                EQ does not. </p>

                            <p>4- Emotional Authenticity provides a process to replace your inaccurate, pain-filled
                                emotional definitions with new, empowering ones that reattach you to your authentic
                                self.
                                EQ does not. </p>


                            <p>5- Emotional Authenticity provides a process to overcome your emotional denial and
                                self-deception, which you must have to live in your authentic self.
                                EQ does not. </p>


                            <p>6- Emotional Authenticity is the only process that gives you the tools to achieve
                                complete emotional self-awareness and live authentically.</p>


                            <p>7- While EQ forms the outer edges, only Emotional Authenticity solves your emotional
                                self-awareness puzzle by filling in the middle, thereby completing your Authentic Self
                                journey.</p>

                            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                            <h4>When does the course start and finish?</h4>
                            <p>The course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you
                                decide when you start and when you finish.
                            </p>


                            <h4>How long do I have access to the course?</h4>
                            <p>How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course
                                for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.
                            </p>



                            <h4>New things scare me. Is this hard to use?</h4>
                            <p>I am not very savvy with technology either. That is why I picked the most effortless
                                platform use I could find. It only takes a few clicks, and you are immediately learning.
                                All of the material and the navigation tools are laid out in a very friendly-to-use
                                manner.
                            </p>


                            <h4>I am swamped. How much time does this take?
                            </h4>
                            <p>All it takes is 15 minutes a day. Just watch one video and answer one question in the
                                Journey books. You will achieve your goals if you can do that four days a week and stick
                                with the process.
                            </p>



                            <h4>Will this Masterclass really work?</h4>
                            <p>It has been my experience that every student who followed the process exactly as I have
                                designed it has achieved their goals. No exceptions!

                            <h3>Are You Ready to Take Your Next Step in Your Journey to Being Yourself?
                            </h3>

                            <p>Where Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) scratch the
                                surface of emotional awareness, My Complete Emotional Authenticity Method provides
                                several advanced solutions that profoundly elevate your internal emotional landscape to
                                a depth and understanding that CBT and EQ do not offer you.
                            </p>

                            <p>﻿Emotional Authenticity dissolves the mysteries and complexities of discovering who you
                                really are by providing a trailblazing process that uncovers what keeps you from living
                                in your authenticity and truth, thus paving the way to manifesting your destiny.
                            </p>

                            <p>Rooted in the latest neuroscience and psychology and my own journey in overcoming my
                                detachment from myself, my cutting-edge Emotional Authenticity approach to identifying
                                and living in your authentic self provides you with the tools and strategies necessary
                                for healing and self-discovery.
                            </p>
